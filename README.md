## Acknowledgements

This blog's content was primarily generated by an AI language model (Claude, created by Anthropic). While the AI produced the majority of the text, I provided the initial prompts, reviewed and edited the output, and made all final decisions regarding the structure and content. My role involved directing the AI, curating its responses, and ensuring the final product aligns with my vision and standards.
