### Ethical Considerations

#### Data Privacy:

- Protecting individual's personal information.
- Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

#### Consent for Data Collection:

- Obtaining informed consent from individuals before collecting their data.
- Clearly communicating how data will be used and stored.

#### Potential Biases in Data:

- Selection bias: When the data is not representative of the population.
- Measurement bias: When the data collection method systematically skews the results.
- Reporting bias: When certain outcomes are more likely to be reported than others.

#### Data Security:

- Implementing measures to protect data from unauthorized access or breaches.
- Ensuring proper data handling and disposal practices.

#### Transparency:

- Being open about data collection methods and analysis techniques.
- Providing access to data and methodologies for verification when appropriate.
