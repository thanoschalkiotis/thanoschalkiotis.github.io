### Types of Data

#### 1. Structured Data

Structured data is organized in a predefined format, typically in rows and columns. It's easily searchable and analyzable by both humans and machines.

Characteristics:

- Follows a consistent, predetermined model
- Often stored in relational databases or spreadsheets
- Each field has a defined purpose and format

Examples:

- Customer information in a CRM system (Name, Email, Phone, Address)
- Financial transactions (Date, Amount, Account, Transaction Type)
- Inventory records (Product ID, Quantity, Price, Location)

#### 2. Unstructured Data

Unstructured data lacks a predefined data model or organization. It's typically text-heavy but can include dates, numbers, and facts.

Characteristics:

- No predefined data model
- Cannot be easily searched using traditional methods
- Requires advanced processing techniques for analysis

Examples:

- Social media posts
- Email bodies
- Audio and video files
- Satellite imagery

#### 3. Semi-structured Data

Semi-structured data has some organizational properties but isn't confined to a rigid structure. It contains tags or markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data.

Characteristics:

- Has organizational properties but not a rigid structure
- Self-describing structure
- Can be irregular or incomplete

Examples:

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files
- XML (eXtensible Markup Language) documents
- NoSQL databases
