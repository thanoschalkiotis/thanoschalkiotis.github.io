## Data Basics: Understanding the Building Blocks of Information

### What is Data?

Data is the foundation of information and knowledge in our digital age. It encompasses any form of recorded observation, measurement, or fact about the world around us. Data can be:

- Quantitative: Numerical information that can be measured and expressed as numbers.
Example: Temperature readings, sales figures, population counts.
- Qualitative: Descriptive information that can be observed but not measured numerically.
Example: Colors, textures, opinions, descriptions.

Data serves as the raw material for analysis, decision-making, and insight generation across various fields, from science and business to social studies and personal life management.
